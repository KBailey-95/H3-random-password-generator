# Random-Password-Generator

## Description

This random password generator was created as a means of testing the progress I have made as a web developer. This project pushed my knowledge of event listeners and DOM manipulation to new levels. I chose to build a password generator because it felt like a practical use case that I would be able to refer back to in my future as a developer. I can envision a future junior developer position where I might be tasked with creatiing or maintaining basic organizatioonal infrastructure such as this.

## Usage

To use this project, simply navigate to https://kbailey-95.github.io/H3-random-password-generator/ and press generate password! No other steps required!

## Credits

I must give thanks to many, many W3 Schools and Mozilla developer links that helped me udnerstand various parts of the process, as well as my TA Paul Keldsen for helping to get me across the finish line when I'd started to ovecomplicate things.
